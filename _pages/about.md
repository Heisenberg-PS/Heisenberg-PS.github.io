My current research interests are recommender systems, fairness, and time series.

I am currently a Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) since the fall of 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Raymond Wong](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/).

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT)](http://www.bupt.edu.cn/), and my final year project "Research on Fairness of Top-k Based on Interactive Search" won the Outstanding Undergraduate Graduation Design (Thesis) of Beijing Ordinary Colleges and Universities under the supervision of [Prof. Jingyu Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H441DjwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

I have worked on mobile computer systems under the supervision of [Prof. Mengwei Xu, BUPT](https://xumengwei.github.io/) and [Dr. Ting Cao, Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ticao/).

I have worked on dynamic graph algorithms as a visiting student at the [University of British Columbia](https://ece.ubc.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Matei Ripeanu](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/matei/), which was supported by [Mitacs globalink research internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) and [China Scholarship Council](https://www.csc.edu.cn/).
